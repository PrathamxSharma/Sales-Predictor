# Sales-Predictor
I created a Sales Predictor using Jupyter for data analysis, PyCharm for coding efficiency, and CSS for an intuitive interface. This project involved model training, exploratory data analysis, and interactive visualization, enabling accurate sales forecasts for better decision-making.
